Approach
Component-Based Architecture: The project was built using a component-based approach in React, which allows for modular and reusable components. Each part of the UI, such as property cards, booking cart, filters, and forms, is encapsulated in its own component.

State Management: The Context API was used to manage global states, including user authentication and property management. This simplifies state management without the need for external libraries like Redux.

Responsive Design: CSS was used to ensure the website is responsive and user-friendly across different devices, enhancing user experience.

Dynamic Rendering: Properties and user interactions are dynamically rendered based on the state, allowing for a fluid experience when booking properties or filtering searches.
